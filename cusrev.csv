In about 90 minutes, most of my symptoms were clear! I kid you not, it really worked. I felt better, my cough stopped and my head started to clear. By 4 hours later, much of my symptoms vanished.<br><br>I then went on to continue with my Zync regimen and my cold was gone in a few days. I am telling you that Sambucol is remarkable and it works. I then came here on Amazon and bought more for my whole family. I hope we don't get sick but if we do, we are prepared and now I know how very effective it is.</span>"", ""link"": ""https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31BO1N1PXOSMX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ES8GGC"", ""rating"": 5, ""date"": {""raw"": ""Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2014"", ""utc"": ""2014-01-21T00:00:00.000Z""}, ""profile"": {""name"": ""Mitch Russo"", ""link"": ""https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHITCP5I5P35JH6CCMQY3JH7XR2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8"", ""id"": ""AHITCP5I5P35JH6CCMQY3JH7XR2A""}, ""vine_program"": false, ""verified_purchase"": true, ""attributes"": [{""name"": ""Size"", ""value"": ""30 Count (Pack of 1)""}], ""attributes_flat"": ""Size: 30 Count (Pack of 1)"", ""helpful_votes"": 7, ""review_country"": ""us"", ""is_global_review"": false, ""position"": 3}",five_star,2024-06-19 20:44:32.000000 UTC

Still kind of tired but overall still feel pretty human.. I think it\u2019s a keeper! In fact I just ordered both the syrup and the gummies as preventative. Based on the sore throat I had Friday I would have thought I could be getting strep throat, Saturday maybe not strep but a cold for sure.

B002VWK10E,"{""id"": ""RCQYJRWG8FE7Q"", ""title"": ""Overwhelming RUBBER stench"", ""body"": ""The footstool is well made (from China)with solid welding of the legs and LOWER handlebar. Assembly (few seconds) involves merely sliding the UPPER handlebar down into the lower one (secured by spring operated metal buttons). The assembled handlebar is very slightly wobbly at the joint, but definitely secure and SAFE. Its purchase was to accommodate our much higher mattress/foundation. Upon arrival and after removing the plastic wrap around the footstool, the rubber stench was very pungent, and relativley overwhelming. I have washed the rubber surface (separately) with lemon scented Mr. Clean detergent (undiluted), white vinegar/water (1:1) soaking for 1/2 hour, baking soda paste (left on over one hour), sprayed on hospital deodorizer (which conceals vomit, fecal, etc odors)and left to bake in direct sunlight for eight hours. The rubber stench is much improved but persists (ie, noticeable as soon as you walk into the room). Googling the remedy for the above, the ONLY likely effective solution is TIME (ie, leave the item in the sun until the odor is tolerable). I got this item ($17.50 more including shipping) instead of the cheaper one (also made in China) because of the latters more involved assembly (poor instructions, suboptimal fasteners, etc), and notable rubber stench. Although not mentioned in the five reviews for THIS footstool, the sample I received definitely has the same problem. That said, the above maneuvers have resulted in an improvement, and I believe with more TIME baking in the sun, I'll be happy with the purchase. However, had I read a review similar to this, I likely would have looked elsewhere (ie, too labor intensive).  UPDATE (7/7/2012): After FOUR weeks of pouring/spreading undiluted white vinegar over the rubber surface, and allowing it to bake in the sun for at least EIGHT hours a day, the rubber stench is essentially GONE (ie, you could BARELY detect a rubber odor with your nostril next to the surface).

IF you have a keen sense of smell, this footstool is still a cost effective viable option with a bit of work:)"", ""asin"": ""B002VWK10E"", ""body_html"": ""<span>The footstool is well made (from China)with solid welding of the legs and LOWER handlebar. Assembly (few seconds) involves merely sliding the UPPER handlebar down into the lower one (secured by spring operated metal buttons). The assembled handlebar is very slightly wobbly at the joint, but definitely secure and SAFE. Its purchase was to accommodate our much higher mattress/foundation. Upon arrival and after removing the plastic wrap around the footstool, the rubber stench was very pungent, and relativley overwhelming. I have washed the rubber surface (separately) with lemon scented Mr. Clean detergent (undiluted), white vinegar/water (1:1) soaking for 1/2 hour, baking soda paste (left on over one hour), sprayed on hospital deodorizer (which conceals vomit, fecal, etc odors)and left to bake in direct sunlight for eight hours. The rubber stench is much improved but persists (ie, noticeable as soon as you walk into the room). Googling the remedy for the above, the ONLY likely effective solution is TIME (ie, leave the item in the sun until the odor is tolerable). I got this item ($17.50 more including shipping) instead of the cheaper one (also made in China) because of the latters more involved assembly (poor instructions, suboptimal fasteners, etc), and notable rubber stench. Although not mentioned in the five reviews for THIS footstool, the sample I received definitely has the same problem. That said, the above maneuvers have resulted in an improvement, and I believe with more TIME baking in the sun, I'll be happy with the purchase. However, had I read a review similar to this, I likely would have looked elsewhere (ie, too labor intensive).<br><br>UPDATE (7/7/2012):<br>After FOUR weeks of pouring/spreading undiluted white vinegar over the rubber surface, and allowing it to bake in the sun for at least EIGHT hours a day, the rubber stench is essentially GONE (ie, you could BARELY detect a rubber odor with your nostril next to the surface). I've seen similar footstools (but ONE piece handle, rubber STRIPS on surface, and probably not made in China) in catalogs for $100 more.

B000CSG5TU,"{""id"": ""R19DXZM50DMQR6"", ""title"": ""Good absorption of leakage. Comfortable under clothing. Fairly noisy, crinkly when moving, walking."", ""body"": ""I have had steady urinary and occasional bowel incontinence for over 20 years as a result of nerve damage from a motorcycle accident and over these decades I have worn too many brands and styles to recall. I have worn Tranquility brand plastic-backed diapers, including their Slimline diapers and their All-Through-The-Night (ATN) diapers. Comparing these two styles to each other, the Slimlines are thinner, with less absorbent core filler material than the ATN's. I have used the Slimlines while out and about, but I needed booster pads inside to better prevent embarrassing leakage. To not use boosters was always a recipe for disaster, unless I was making a short trip to the grocery store or to pickup a food order because they would inevitably leak. For clarification, my bladder leaks urine pretty constantly in small dribbles, nonstop, without my knowledge whatsoever throughout day or night. I just don't feel anything happening down there and don't realize when my diaper is needing to be changed until there is leakage or the diaper swells enough to be noticeable when I walk or visible under my clothing. A Slimline just doesn't last me for more than two or three hours, especially when I have had a lot of water or some other drinks, or when I have experienced bowel incontinence. In comparison, the ATN diapers get me through twice as many hours and very often can allow me to survive most of my workday without a diaper change until the last hour or so of my workday, except when I have a bowel movement which requires an immediate trip to the restroom, of course. Overnight, the ATN's work pretty well, but I have noticed some leakage from the top-backside of the diaper, which may have more to do with there being no elastic in the tops of the diapers and the fact that I change positions in bed from lying on my back to lying on my side, back and forth. Both the Slimlines and the ATN's are discreet and not thick, which some wearers appreciate. As for me, I have worn slimmer diapers, as well as thicker and bulkier diapers, and I really don't care which style of diaper I wear so long as it does its job to keep me and my clothing dry. I have tried the cloth-like diapers and, in my experience, they tend to leak both urine and odor, which is why I have long preferred plastic-backed diapers. Yes, plastic-backed diapers can be somewhat noisy, making a \""crinkling\"" sound when I walk, sit/stand or move, but either nobody else hears it because my clothing muffles those sounds or other people respect my privacy and say nothing (or don't realize the sounds are coming from my diaper). Either way, the crinkling is not a problem for me. I much prefer the noises (loud or soft) to leakage from my diaper. The Slimlines and ATN's are both plastic-backed styles. These both have elastic inner leg gathers, too, which greatly helps to contain and channel voids (urine and feces), which is a feature that some cheaper diapers do not incorporate into their designs in order to reduce manufacturing costs, in my opinion. Even the ATN's with its increased absorption capacity and fast wicking due to its unique peach-colored core down the inside middle of the diapers does not compare with the high-end designer diapers such as those targeted to the ABDL (Adult Baby and/or Diaper Lover) markets, but the cost of the Tranquility ATN's, even with the addition of Tranquility's diaper boosters/inserts to increase void capacity, is significantly more affordable, especially when purchased in bulk (Tranquility's Slimline and ATN medium diapers come in case sizes of 96) and on a recurring autoship monthly basis, which offers a further discount, as well as relieving my worries about running out before remembering to order more diapers and needing to rush ship an order. I normally go through about three, sometimes fpur, diapers per day (morning, evening and overnight), but I can burn through diapers during the Summer when I drink more fluid due to the heat. I also change more frequently when I sweat more, which a plastic-backed diaper can cause you to do, or when I can smell my diaper's contents when I sit or walk, which makes me self-conscious that others, too, can \""smell me\""...or when I just feel \""icky\"" or notice my diaper bulging through my clothing, or my diaper causing me to walk differently, or when I can hear squishy noises or feel clumping in my diaper (neither, of which, is usually an issue with the ATN diapers, but is often a problem with those cheap diapers that my insurance and the hospital provides for me). So, yeah, I would recommend the Tranquility ATN's for most folks who need them, like myself. They are not fancy with designs all over them, or made to last all day long, but for those qualities I would recommend diapers made for ABDL customers."", ""asin"": ""B000CSG5TU"", ""body_html"": ""<span>I have had steady urinary and occasional bowel incontinence for over 20 years as a result of nerve damage from a motorcycle accident and over these decades I have worn too many brands and styles to recall.

In comparison, the ATN diapers get me through twice as many hours and very often can allow me to survive most of my workday without a diaper change until the last hour or so of my workday, except when I have a bowel movement which requires an immediate trip to the restroom, of course. Overnight, the ATN's work pretty well, but I have noticed some leakage from the top-backside of the diaper, which may have more to do with there being no elastic in the tops of the diapers and the fact that I change positions in bed from lying on my back to lying on my side, back and forth. Both the Slimlines and the ATN's are discreet and not thick, which some wearers appreciate. As for me, I have worn slimmer diapers, as well as thicker and bulkier diapers, and I really don't care which style of diaper I wear so long as it does its job to keep me and my clothing dry. I have tried the cloth-like diapers and, in my experience, they tend to leak both urine and odor, which is why I have long preferred plastic-backed diapers. Yes, plastic-backed diapers can be somewhat noisy, making a \""crinkling\"" sound when I walk, sit/stand or move, but either nobody else hears it because my clothing muffles those sounds or other people respect my privacy and say nothing (or don't realize the sounds are coming from my diaper). Either way, the crinkling is not a problem for me. I much prefer the noises (loud or soft) to leakage from my diaper. The Slimlines and ATN's are both plastic-backed styles. These both have elastic inner leg gathers, too, which greatly helps to contain and channel voids (urine and feces), which is a feature that some cheaper diapers do not incorporate into their designs in order to reduce manufacturing costs, in my opinion. Even the ATN's with its increased absorption capacity and fast wicking due to its unique peach-colored core down the inside middle of the diapers does not compare with the high-end designer diapers such as those targeted to the ABDL (Adult Baby and/or Diaper Lover) markets, but the cost of the Tranquility ATN's, even with the addition of Tranquility's diaper boosters/inserts to increase void capacity, is significantly more affordable, especially when purchased in bulk (Tranquility's Slimline and ATN medium diapers come in case sizes of 96) and on a recurring autoship monthly basis, which offers a further discount, as well as relieving my worries about running out before remembering to order more diapers and needing to rush ship an order. I normally go through about three, sometimes fpur, diapers per day (morning, evening and overnight), but I can burn through diapers during the Summer when I drink more fluid due to the heat. I also change more frequently when I sweat more, which a plastic-backed diaper can cause you to do, or when I can smell my diaper's contents when I sit or walk, which makes me self-conscious that others, too, can \""smell me\""...or when I just feel \""icky\"" or notice my diaper bulging through my clothing, or my diaper causing me to walk differently, or when I can hear squishy noises or feel clumping in my diaper (neither, of which, is usually an issue with the ATN diapers, but is often a problem with those cheap diapers that my insurance and the hospital provides for me). So, yeah, I would recommend the Tranquility ATN's for most folks who need them, like myself. They are not fancy with designs all over them, or made to last all day long, but for those qualities I would recommend diapers made for ABDL customers.</span>"", ""link"": ""https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19DXZM50DMQR6?ASIN=B000CSG5TU"", ""rating"": 5, ""date"": {""raw"": ""Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2022"", ""utc"": ""2022-05-25T00:00:00.000Z""}, ""profile"": {""name"": ""Daryl &amp; Norma Wilson"", ""link"": ""https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEEPG7YYIYKVV7UFGIERTHO43NIQ"", ""id"": ""AEEPG7YYIYKVV7UFGIERTHO43NIQ"", ""image"": ""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/943e3da8-2d3d-40c2-8394-e10973b8c7cb._CR62,0,375,375_SX48_.jpg""}, ""vine_program"": false, ""verified_purchase"": true, ""attributes"": [{""name"": ""Size"", ""value"": ""Medium""}, {""name"": ""Style"", ""value"": ""Case of 96""}], ""attributes_flat"": ""Size: Medium, Style: Case of 96"", ""helpful_votes"": 30, ""review_country"": ""us"", ""is_global_review"": false, ""position"": 1}",five_star,2024-06-19 04:27:36.000000 UTC
B000CSG5TU,"{""id"": ""R3TJR1YF1ARSR8"", ""title"": ""Tranquility All-thru-the-Night (ATN) Diapers are the best diapers for the price"", ""body"": ""Hi, For those that never tried this product, this is the Tranquility All-thru-the-night (ATN) Briefs/Diapers. They have the tabs on the side and you have to pull it around to tape the diaper close. They\u2019re also plastic backed diapers not cloth backed. Think of it as a larger version of a traditional disposable baby diaper. If you\u2019re looking for the ones that are like pull ups, Tranquility does offer one called the Tranquility Premium Overnight Pull-On Briefs/Diapers and those are put on like regular underwear. With that said, here is what I think of this product. For the price, I think this is the best disposable diaper out there. I\u2019ve been using this product for about four years now. I tried many different brands but I think overall this is still the best I\u2019ve tried. One reason is that they hold a lot of liquid. What make these diapers stand out is one: they don\u2019t feel wet after I wet them and two: they hold a lot of liquid under pressure. Even after a wetting while sitting, the diaper doesn\u2019t leak. They hold about 34 oz. of liquid (about three to four voids) and while I never went further than two wettings, I think they can still hold up past that. They have what\u2019s called the Peach Mat construction which helps in absorbency as well. They also very durable, lasting over 8 hours. The diaper itself are about mid-pack in terms of thickness. They\u2019re thicker than a Depends Maximum protection, First Quality, Presto, and Assurance brands I\u2019ve tested. The Abena Abri-Forms are thicker as well as the Attends (just somewhat). The Northshore and Confidry brands offer thicker diapers as well. As for fecal containment, this diaper does a good job of containing it. It\u2019s also I think the best at concealing the odor too. I wear the extra-large (fitting 56 \u2013 64 in. waist) and I have plenty of room in them. I can also fit in the size large diapers (fitting 45 \u2013 58 in. waist) too with some room to spare. They\u2019re fairly large so they can fit most. Because they\u2019re not overly thick, they\u2019re fairly easy to conceal under clothing. As long as you don\u2019t wear something too tight, no one should notice these under your clothing. They have a few drawbacks though. One, the tapes to keep the diaper in place are very sticky and once fastened, they\u2019re very difficult to move without tearing the diaper. If you mess up on fastening your diaper close, it\u2019s pretty much stuck and good luck opening it without tearing it. I had this issue a few times but for the most part I can usually avoid this. For those that just ordered or is considering ordering this product just be aware of this when fastening it close. The second drawback is that they crinkle a lot. These are some of the loudest diapers that I ever worn. If noise is an issue for you, then you should consider this before buying. If it isn\u2019t, then I think you should give it a try. For me, this is still the best diaper for me. I still want to try some other brands out there but right now I haven\u2019t found a product that surpasses this one. You usually can find a bag of Tranquility for around $15 bucks, which isn\u2019t too steep. They\u2019re durable, hold a lot of liquid, hold a lot of liquid under pressure, not too thick, fairly easy to conceal, and fit comfortably. Of course, their tapes can be an issue at times and they do crinkle a lot. More so than any brand I\u2019ve tried thus far. In the end, if you\u2019re still interested I think you should really consider trying Tranquility All-thru-the-Night (ATN) Briefs/Diapers. You will be getting a truly exceptional product.

Even on the second round I can totally flood it and assuming I don't immediately smash my bottom into a hard surface, it holds very well. Depend told me they are re-engineering their product, but it won't be plastic anymore, so I likely won't buy it again.  ATNs can also be compared to the Tena Slip Maxi (which sadly, has also become very hard to find) I think the Tenas had a sexier look, though the tapes on these ATNs work much better.  I also use the purple Molicare diapers and Abena M4s. Those have higher capacity and they are useful for occasions when I know I won't be able to change for many hours, but I find these ATNs to be much more comfortable (especially at night) and easier to wear in every day life. I can wear a wet ATN under a tight pair of jeans in almost any environment and nobody can tell. Not even my boyfriend who was playing with my butt realized I was wearing it.  My only complaint with these is the excess material in the top. That material probably has some usefulness at night laying down, but in the day time I tuck it way so the diaper does not stick out the top of my pants and become obvious to others around me, but it's a little less comfortable that way (that is one area I feel the Depends and Tena Maxis have the advantage).  Like all the diapers I mentioned, these are also plastic backed. I think plastic diapers are awesome and sad that they are getting so difficult to find anymore.
