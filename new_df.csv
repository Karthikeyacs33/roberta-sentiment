I initially got a prescription cream, then my dermatologist said I should go ahead and just use Sarna...which is $10 a pop even at Wal-Mart. It hasn't un-pinched the nerve but it does give my back relief as good as a mild prescription cortisone cream.  Because of the cost, I use it sparingly on dry itchy skin and save the inexpensive stuff for just the dry skin. I sometimes find it tucked away on the clearance shelf at Walmart in the corner, at which time I scarf them up.

When I read the product info I knew that the floor to stool height would be a challenge for me but thought that if the unit was safe for a heavier person, I could use the support of the handle to help get my leg onto the platform. Not really happy with how it feels to use the handle to get onto the stool part because it seems wobbly.

You only get 2 tries tho to get the diaper on good because both sets of tape are super sticky and will rip the diaper when you pull them off. 5 out of 5 for quality to price ratio.

That being said, for years he has woken up with his whole side, tshirt, and bed pad soaked because the diapers leak out the side. I did a lot of research and saw these had side absorbancy as well. We ordered them and they are AMAZING and worth the higher price. I use less expensive diapers for daytime use when he is sitting up, but these are awesome for night time use. They are the first ones that have not leaked and allows me to sleep through the night as well as him.

R2YEWZX3VVUSPA,B000CSG5TU,Excellent Adult Brief,"After trying many brands, this product is a very good adult diaper especially for daytime use. This brief offers excellent odor control while the absorbent padding doesn't get ""stiff"" and lumpy when wet like most other adult incontinence products. This means it stays comfortable for a much longer time. The plastic backing works much better for me than the other ""breathable"" products since clothing and bedding slides over the backing surface much easier - and this makes the brief virtually leak-free with non of the dampness that soaks thru the breathable types. Even with the plastic backing the brief is very quiet and not at all noticeable under jeans, and makes dressing a lot easier.  For night use, as with all adult diaper briefs, a waterproof overpant will help prevent leaks especially for men. Depending on the amount of nighttime flow, the Tranquility Booster Pads will also help a lot to prevent any leaks, and this helps keep the bed perfectly dry.  Highly recommended for diabetics and other incontinence issues, from moderate to heavy incontinence - and with a good price point to boot!",5,0.0076764230616390705,0.08205141872167587,0.9102721810340881

R1CSKLQXSZ7OZ2,B001ES8GGC,USE IMMEDIATELY AT FIRST SIGN OF COLD/FLU SYMPTOMS,"I see one star reviews from ignorant reviewers that didn't follow instructions. If you already have a full fledged cold or flu, this doesn't do that much. But, it's great at preventing cold/flu. In winter, I take one a day and rarely ever get sick. Once in a blue moon, if I'm around a sick family member, I lose the battle, but that's usually because I didn't take it fast enough. If you feel a tickle in your throat, even if you're not sure, take it, IMMEDIATELY. Feel any other type of cold/flu symptoms, TAKE IT IMMEDIATELY! That's what I believe the key to be. It helps prevent a virus from taking over if you catch it right when you caught it. If you wait, it might provide some moderate relief, but generally doesn't just end the cold or flu. It its better at preventing it, not curing it. Remember, after a million years, we still DON""T HAVE A CURE FOR THE COMMON COLD. Preventative!! Is the key. It works wonders at that. Box says right on the front, take at FIRST SIGN OF SYMPTOMS. Don't be cavalier about it and take it 3-4 hours later. You'll probably be too late. I always have some in the car or my suit case just in case. Very similar to Oscillococcinum.

R3DXCQW4MT59VR,B001ES8GGC,Skepticism averted,"My husband had been diagnosed with the flu, so I started him on this as suggested by the pharmacy staff, even though I was initially very skeptical. The price at the drug store was twice as much so, after buying the first batch in-person so I could have it immediately, I ordered the second batch through Amazon. I had my husband taking this every 4 hours and he noticed his throat wasn't nearly as sore and his other symptoms weren't so bad either. When he would forget to take it regularly, he'd notice his pain came back. I started taking the liquid form every 4 hours to avoid getting the flu while taking care of my husband (I would take these tablets if I didn't have the liquid on hand). I never developed a fever or any flu symptoms, which says a lot because I was definitely under stress (working ~80 hrs week while taking care of sick husband) which wrecks havoc on the immune system. If you're taking care of someone ill, know that a bug is being passed around your office, or get that little scratchy throat that signals the start of sickness- start taking this immediately to protect yourself. I now keep a bottle of the liquid in my desk at work, the medicine cabinet at home and gave more of the tablets to my hubby to keep in his desk at work (he isn't a fan of measuring out the liquid, even though it comes with it's own medicine cup).

My colds never stay ""just a cold""....I always end up with secondary infections (bronchitis, sinus infection, and even pneumonia) and stay sick for over a month. Not wanting to spend another Christmas season sitting in a doctor's office, I bought this. Three days after he got sick, I started feeling like I was coming down with it. Panic set in! I started taking this faithfully every 3-4 hours. Got up the next day with a slight sore throat, but stayed the course and kept taking this on schedule and continued taking it for the next 4 days. No cold for me! No secondary infections! Happy, happy, happy! Meanwhile, his cold took a turn for the worse...instead of getting better, he was getting worse. Had him start taking it, too! One day after starting to take it, he was completely over the cold! This stuff should be in every home and I honestly believe that taking it at the first sign of illness will kick it to the curb.

Needless to say our immune systems have tanked.

And YAY this product is the bomb! It does come in a syrup, however, we love the melt under your tongue sublinguals.  It is imperative that I look up everything we take and here is a snippet from WebMD: ""Why do people take elderberry? Elderberries contain natural substances called flavonoids. They seem to help reduce swelling, fight inflammation, and boost the immune system. Studies have found that elderberry eases flu symptoms like fever, headache, sore throat, fatigue, cough, and body ache. The benefits seem to be greatest when started within 24 to 48 hours after the symptoms begin. One study found that elderberry could cut the duration of flu symptoms by more than 50%. Lab studies have found that elderberry might be effective against H1N1, or swine flu. A few studies have suggested that elderberry could help with bacterial sinus infections or bronchitis. More research needs to be done. People use elderberry for high cholesterol, HIV, and many other conditions. For now, we don’t have good evidence to support these uses...""

So I went and we passed a vitamin store, I asked what they had for a bad cold. The salesman perked right up sensing a definite sale of almost any woo-woo crap he had to offer. And he did, except something totally unexpected happened. In about 90 minutes, most of my symptoms were clear! I kid you not, it really worked. I felt better, my cough stopped and my head started to clear. By 4 hours later, much of my symptoms vanished.  I then went on to continue with my Zync regimen and my cold was gone in a few days.

I was very disappointed when Medicaid stopped covering Tranquility ATNs. Because they perform so well I decided to stick with them even though I had to buy them out-of-pocket. I searched the Web for hours and phoned every medical supply company in my county to find the best value. Amazon's case price is $15-$18 less than my local sources.

The blue tab has mild adhesive that works for placement, but any strain, and it gives way. When you remove the blue tab, the remaining tab has much stronger adhesive, but removing it will tear the plastic, so no repositioning is possible. Note that the Small is very small, and the Medium is significantly bigger. In our case, the S was too small and the M was too big.

Also as a suggestion, they need 3 tapes not 2 as there is a gap between them, as a result if you sleep on your side they may leak but plastic pants fix that.

R3N2JZVDUT76D8,B008VPD6IE,Keeps the Pain Down,"Smaller incisions mean less impact to your skin, but beware of misidentification....  This product, ACCU-CHEK FastClix Lancets, is a round cannister housing six lancets (needles) which are sealed in the separately-provided lancing tool. One uses the tool by rotating the cannister with a lever within the lancing tool, making a virgin cleaned lancet available. When six lancets have been used, one discards the cannister and inserts another. About sixteen canisters are provided with each package of product.  I use the ACCU-CHEK lancing device daily to produce blood samples from my fingers for blood sugar analysis. When I used the individual common blue ""Safety Seal"" lancets the skin on my fingers would become damaged over time because of having been repeatedly punctured by the lancet (needle). The skin on my fingers became hard and less sensitive.  That does not happen with Roche's ACCU-CHEK system. The impact to my fingers is less. The needle is more sharp, and its diameter smaller. A smaller hole is punched in my finger tip but the volume of blood produced is adequate for the blood sugar test administered with the ACCU-CHEK meter.  The problem with use of this product is that there is another which appears the same, but is differently sized. It’s difficult to tell the two apart, but they are not interchangeable. They are used in separate lancing tools. I mistakenly ordered the wrong one (it’s called ACCU-CHEK Multiclix Lancets). Don’t you do that!

In addition to night use, they are also great during the day for long trips or having to sit for long periods without convenient opportunities to quickly change, and they are not too bulky to wear under normal daytime clothes like jeans, khakis, or even shorts. While I normally use depend underwear in the day, if I am going for an evening out, traveling, or somewhere I know I will not be able to make it to the bathroom, I will more often than not use these instead for extra peace of mind. Lastly, these have a plastic back sheet, which may be a bit nosier (though not so loud that even under shorts, neither me nor others can hear them), but I found that the plastic works better, especially for night and situations where I can't go change right away as it really makes the brief feel more secure, which lets me still feel protected and confident even when I am out and have to wait to find a place to change.",5,0.015492495149374008,0.15245360136032104,0.8320539593696594

I had been running a diffuser with essential oils, spraying air freshener, burning candles, using wax melts, cleaning, but nothing could mask the pungent odor of the off-gassing of the bag. Nothing. (This situation is not a colostomy bag but a catheter bag for my friend with terminal cancer who has a fistula of the colon and bladder so the Foley catheter has become essentially a colostomy bag.) Tough situation when they don't really have odor solutions for this type of medical issue. Long story short, I simply add several drops of this wonderful product down into a fresh bag each time it's changed and finally, the odor is barely even noticable IF at all. No more sprays, oils, or candles needed. I went from having to change the bag every single day to being able to change it every couple of days or longer with no problems whatsoever. Very thankful to have come across this product. It makes my life much simpler and I can certainly use that these days!",5,0.018000904470682144,0.07481592893600464,0.9071832299232483

R1GWI54UNDDUAQ,B001ES8GGC,"85% Better in 2 days, I’m a believer!","I just got over the influenza A after missing a week and a half at work as well as having severe symptoms from January 2nd =10. I was surprised and overwhelmed when I woke up January 25 th with a severe sore throat I had 2 more days to work with a no symptom work policy and no more paid time off available; being sick was not an option I had to figure out a way to kick it or make it leavecwith out work noticing because obviously I can’t afford to be off work again so soon. I spent my lunch scanning the internet and after work planned to puck up another product at the pharmacy. I found the pharmacy to be out of the product I came for and felt deflated exhausted and overwhelmed especially since I worked a double the night before got off late and was back up at 3:15 am to start again. (I needed to get as many hours as possible to cover my previous time off). I could not bring myself to drive across town to another pharmacy so I scanned the natural remedies and chose this one knowing elderberries were super immune boosters and hey what ddI I have to lose. I spent the rest of day watching the clock like a hawk so I could take my next dose until bed and took it every time I got up during the night. I was a bit deflated when I woke up with cold symptoms the next morning although my sore throat was slightly less I had other symptoms and my voice sounded sick. I was praying I wouldn’t get sent ho,e sick but it was Saturday so I tried to just lay low. I shared my quick melts with other coworkers who were also starting to get sick and made through the work day thankfully. I continued to have symptoms throughout the evening but much less pronounced than my previous experiences with viral attacks so I though maybe it would at least help reduce it so I would stay positive. Continued my 3 hour dosing until bed and twice during the night. Sunday morning 49 hours later , hmmm symptoms are mild but to gone, I made breakfast, yep can still taste! Still kind of tired but overall still feel pretty human.. I think it’s a keeper! In fact I just ordered both the syrup and the gummies as preventative.

RYJDHKLCKZLR7,B001ES8GGC,Reduces symptoms greatly,So I had the flu earlier this year and after getting better i wanted to make sure it didn't come back so i went online looking for things that could help with cold and flu. I take this twice a day when i feel like i am coming down with something and it definitely helps at the first sign of symptoms. It does give me a headache for some reason so i don't think i would ever take it every 3 hours but I''m thinking of giving this to my son (4) to help with his cold and flu from being in pre kindergarten.,4,0.29509472846984863,0.4481741786003113,0.2567310929298401

I hated fishing out the test strips out of my tester brand and having to load the lancer each time.  I expect accuracy is good. I occasionally check with my other tester and see if they match. They tend to be close to each other. I suspect no home tester is ever really accurate. Even the control solutions have a 30 mg/Dl range for Level 1.

They are much better than regular lancets and very portable. I especially like how easy it is to change a barrel instead of those tiny lancets.  But just because the needles are not exposed does not mean that it is safe to put these in the trash as some people do. If you have ever watched (some types of) garbage truck, you will see that the trash gets crushed by the scoop. If the barrel breaks then there will be lots of little needles loose in the trash. Also this is a bio-hazard, so please do dispose of these properly. These barrels are still much easier to dispose of then regular lancets.  Once, I was cleaning up some spilled trash at school, and I did get stabbed by multiple needles from a barrel similar to this one -- but a different brand. At the time I couldn't figure out what it was for (I know now). But there also did not seem to be a safe way to pick *that* barrel up without getting stabbed; after I got stabbed the first time, I dropped it, but then I still had to pick it up to get rid of it and I got stabbed the second time too, even though I was trying to be careful. So please don't put these in the trash, the danger is real.  Clarification: These barrels do not have exposed needles unless they are damaged, these are very easy to handle.

She recently got a cold so I ordered these since they work out to be cheaper than the syrup. It worked, however, she kept getting random itchy, raises spots on her body that looked like hives. It happened on her face, chest, back and legs. Nothing else was different aside from adding these chewables. I read the ingredients and see many other things added, and that could have possibly caused a slight allergic reaction. I don’t know why I didn’t look at that before purchasing it. I don’t want to try this again, in case it happens again, and reactions can be worse the next time around, which is a chance I didn’t want to take.

Now on the scar lightening/removing claims I have yet to really see any of those improvements, though I understand that to achieve those takes a longer time and full commitment. I have seen a couple spots disappear and reappear now and then, or was that my dirty mirror...wait....lol.

Instead they glide on easily (sometimes you have to warm them in your palm for a minute) should sink into your skin easily too.  I like this oil, it goes in easily and has a faint pleasant smell (some Declore oils are too strongly scented for me) This comes in a plastic bottle which is actually a benefit, because your fingers get slippery and I've shattered an expensive oil moisturizer before. It claims to be very effective on scars. I don't have much scarring but I do have uneven skin tone. I haven't noticed a huge difference since using it, but I have very sensitive eyes and they haven't reacted to this oil, so that's a big plus for me.  Edited to add that when I finished this bottle I did order another one, so it's definitely worth having in the house for me.

If I accidentally use too much, I just blot the excess with toilet paper. Some reviewers complain about the smell but I love it. It think it has a subtle floral smell which dissipates throughout the day. I use this product in the morning and at night after I wash my face. Four starts because of it being a great facial moisturizer but minus one star for not helping my stretch marks. I'm still buying this product and will continue to buy.",4,0.06468947231769562,0.169759601354599,0.765550971031189

I have dry skin, and this product helped to lock in essential moisture without clogging my pores. However, I found that it was a bit too oily for my liking, and I had to be careful not to use too much at once. One thing that I found interesting about this product was the unique smell. It's hard to describe, but it has a slightly medicinal scent mixed with floral notes. While it may not be for everyone, I found that it wasn't too overpowering and eventually got used to it. However, the scent may be a deal-breaker for some.

I use it in the morning before I get my day started and then again in the evening before bed. I apply generous amounts on my face neck and both of my forearms. I was a bit worried that I would go through the bottle so quickly, but I'm surprised I still have plenty.  This product works well. I noticed that many of my stubborn acne scars and blemishes have faded. I had some pretty bad blemishes around my neck from tweezing and poking at in-grown hair and those have nearly disappeared, and I'm no longer embarrassed or forced to try to cover up with makeup (which obviously just made my neck worst). It has also worked well to reduce the wrinkles on my forehead and laugh marks/wrinkles, and it has even out my skin tone. I tend to scar and get dark spots from bug bites and I've found that this product also works on those. I did notice, however, that it does not work as well or quickly on more recent blemishes nor does it work on fading freckles.  The product itself is moisturizing and it has replaced my daily face lotion. But it does leave my face looking oily.

R1LB0JR0ZP9A7F,B000VPPUEA,Miracle or mistake?,"I have used this a lot over the years and I still struggle with whether I love it or not. THE GOOD: It is highly moisturizing, as I'm sure many have noticed. I have chronic dry skin and this stuff definitely improves dry patches and dehydrated skin. It seems to have made a difference on my stretch marks. It did not break me out on any place I used it, including my nose. THE BAD: This stuff is probably too greasy for a lot of people. It's oil, duh~ The scent is very strong and kinda weird, but not bad. I don't believe it to be an added scent, just the natural smell of the oil. It is very expensive!! When you use it daily like I do, this stuff can make a small dent in your budget. It takes time to see results...in my experience anyway. OVERALL: I bought this originally for its stretch mark promises, but fell in love with it for its moisturizing results. I do believe over time(2-3 months) this can drastically improve the texture of the marks and help speed up the fading process. The key is repetition with this stuff. I use it when I get out of the shower so it will soak into my pores better. I put in on my legs, hips and arms and massage the affected areas to break up scar tissue and work it into the skin. This has been the best thing I have tried for the marks and it has lightened them and smoothed out the marks by at least half of what they used to be. I'm not sure this will improve marks that have already turned silver/white but it does help the texture/redness. I hear people argue that ANY moisturizer/lotion will improve the LOOK of the marks because it hydrates the skin. Yes, that is true, BUT this improves the the marks on a different level....it actually changes the mark physically, not just improving the LOOK of it for a few days. So, if your willing to take the time and spend a little money on this stuff, I DO believe almost everyone will see major results.",4,0.053197089582681656,0.2638545334339142,0.6829484105110168

R3KPXZOS5NJYJE,B000VPPUEA,Great product for stretch marks but the results take time.,"The oil arrived as described with no issues.  First, this is a great product but don’t expect immediate results. My son went through a rapid growth spurt and ended up with some stretch marks in his back. His mom recommend this and I purchased some for him.  So, the oil is easily applied to the skin. A little goes along way. Results…there has been improvements in the look and depth of his stretch marks but it takes time. The changes occur slowly. I didn’t expect significant changes in a short period of time so I haven’t been disappointed. I knew it was a process but the oil has definitely helped.  I applied it at night for him and he typically worn an old black shirt to deal with any residue. I found prior to bed to be the easiest time to do. Also, the oil has no smell.

Just so people know, one of the last anaphylactic shock reactions I had resulted in this information - one of the ER doctors gave me a shot of Tagamet! I said my stomach doesn't hurt, I'm having an allergic reaction and can't breath. His boss/colleague informed me that they had found out that Tagamet has a powerful histamine blocker and it works for allergic reactions. Ever since then I have first taken Tagamet when I think I might have a problem and it has saved me many times over! Just thought I would share this information as not many people are aware of this.

I had taken it once before, a few years ago, and it had helped clear my breathing. I'm not sure if the formula has changed, or I got a bad batch, or if something else was going on. If anything, the benadryl seemed to make some some head/neck inflammation I had been experiencing, worse.  SO I TRIED...  After trying this product with no result, I ordered a different product I'd used previously to clear my sinuses, Jarrow sustained-release NAC (N Acetyl Cysteine). It worked better for me than the Benadryl.  P.S. Several reviewers have said they find this product (Benadryl gel caps) hard to open. I'm not sure why they're having problems, unless they're forgetting to remove the backing. Here's an easy way to open them:  1) Pull out a perforated sheet with 12 capsules on it 2) Tear off one of the 12 squares (holding one capsule) 3) Bend back the indicated corner (marked with a black arrow), and tear off the paper backing. 4) Then just slit the foil with a fingernail or thumbnail, and pop out the capsule.",2,0.44691675901412964,0.4194718301296234,0.13361136615276337

R1ZO7VXDKZ1H4B,B002VWK10E,Sturdy and Reliable Step Stool,"I recently purchased this Step Stool, and it has proven to be an excellent addition to my home. Here are some reasons why I'm very satisfied with this product:  Sturdy Construction: The step stool is built with a strong, durable silver finish that ensures stability and longevity. It feels solid and secure when in use, providing confidence even when bearing substantial weight.  Non-Slip Surface: The step surface has a non-slip rubber platform, which adds an extra layer of safety. I don’t have to worry about slipping, even if I’m using it with wet feet.  Versatile Use: This step stool is incredibly versatile. Whether reaching high shelves in the kitchen, getting into bed, or even as a support in the bathroom, it serves multiple purposes around the house.  Compact Design: Despite its robust build, the stool is compact and doesn’t take up much space. It’s easy to store away when not in use, fitting neatly in a closet or under a bed.  Height: The stool provides just the right amount of height to help me reach things without feeling precarious. It’s perfect for those little extra inches needed for various tasks around the home.  Final Thoughts: The Drive Medical Step Stool is a reliable, well-constructed, and versatile product that meets all my needs. Its sturdy build, non-slip surface, and compact design make it an excellent choice for anyone looking for a safe and dependable step stool. Highly recommended!",5,0.002541583962738514,0.036331504583358765,0.9611269235610962
R291SZ56FW8Y76,B002VWK10E,Sturdy,"My kids haven't been able to destroy it. That means it is *very* sturdy. They have destroyed many footstools. And the non-slip mat doesn't flip up at its edges. That's nice. It also doesn't flip upside down when I try to pick it up to move it. Lots of plastic footsteps are so d--- top heavy that they flip easily when I am trying to move them with the only hand I have available most of the time (I have a baby...so I live with one hand and the other hand is always in use doing something). It is heavier than plastic (obviously). But it can handle big kids and little kids. And it is not too heavy for my 4 year old to lift. But it is heavy enough to discourage them from moving it from key spots where I want to keep it unless they *really* need to move it. And this fantastic little stool isn't so high than it enables my kids to get to places where I don't want them to go. But it is higher than the usual kiddie single step stools. Gets my 4 yr old the sinks, the 8 yr old and 10 yr old to the lowest rung of cabinets. The parts that touch the ground are nice because they work well to help it stay put. It is worth it to buy this if you have little kids or bigger kids. It can take the heat, so to speak.",5,0.09625314921140671,0.3313303291797638,0.5724164843559265
R2NOHPT8DEZ97Q,B002VWK10E,Awesome product,"I purchased this step stool for my aging mother who needs double hip replacement surgery so she can get in/out of my car with ease. I have a large SUV that sits high off the ground and she was using a flimsy folding step stool that I was afraid would crumble under her weight one day. This step stool has a tall handle, it's made of sturdy steel, has a rubberized step and isn't too tall to where she struggles (she's very petite) stepping up onto it. It's a little bulky to maneuver in/out of my car because it doesn't fold; HOWEVER, I knew it wasn't a folding stool when I purchased it and wanted a non-folding stool because I felt it would be more trust-worthy than a folding stool. Overall, this is an awesome product and I'm so happy I bought it. Most importantly, it helps my mother maintain some aspects of her independence and that's very important.",5,0.012180798687040806,0.08147326111793518,0.9063459634780884

She holds the handle for stability with her left hand when she uses a long shoe horn to slip into sneakers. The metal tubing is better than the aluminum tubing used for bathing chairs. The speckled paint helps with grabbing. I wish there is foam wrap on the top of handle bar but I can always wrap a piece of towel or rope it for a better grip. The height is 9”. Buyers should make sure the users can step up 9”. The handle is for stability once the user steps on the stool, not a mean to get on top of the stool. It is also not designed for really heavy ppl. My mother is about 150lb, that is not too heavy for this stool. I am satisfied with the surface area and the rubber mat. It is big and grippy enough. Overall, a quality product.",5,0.06363178044557571,0.36180487275123596,0.5745633840560913

We chose this stool because: it was the right height for our needs; it looked tip-resistant (not tipping so far!), and slip-resistant (ditto, thanks the the textured grippy surface), and could handle adult weight.  Some of the stools we considered were stackable, foldable or otherwise portable. This is not at all. But it is super study and will probably last for years, unlike the plastic ones.  A lot of other stools are geared to toddlers and preschoolers and have a low weight limit like 50 lb. if I were looking for a stool for my little ones, I'd choose this over those, because once they outgrow it, it will still be useful for other purposes.

I felt safe using it because it was so sturdy and it was so easy to assemble my 72 year old father put it together for me, which made him feel helpful.

She can't bend her knee and can't get up into the high van. I read many reviews on the best stepstools, so thought this one might be good. And it's been a Godsend, to say the least. The height it perfect. The slip guard on top gives her comfort, as she has balance issues, and it is great. And the rubber bottoms allows it not to slip on the sidewalk either. She feels truly secure as I help her get into the van that it won't budge, and it never has.

Takes a tiny bit of blood, and comes with controls so you can check the accuracy of the meter and stix. The lancet device is brilliant - load a little drum which has 6 lancets in it and you never have to worry about dealing with any sharp points. It's also almost painless - the lancets are really thin so you don't have sore fingers. I didn't bother with the phone app as I prefer to just write my BS down, so I can't review that part. Also comes with a case that holds the lancet device, meter and box of test strips.

Excellent technical support if any questions.,"I have been using 21 gauge lancets for fingerstick INR's (not blood glucose levels) for the past 16 years. I finally decided to use a more automated approach with the Accu-Chek FastClick device. This device uses much smaller (and much more comfortable) 30 gauge lancets. The device uses a skin penetration from a very low level of 0.5 to the highest level of penetration of 5.5. When I first used the Accu-Chek device, I used a level of 2, and the lancet did not even penetrate my skin. I thought it was not working. I contacted Accu-Chek and the advisor told me to use a higher level. I increased the level to 3, and the lancet did penetrate the skin, but only a very tiny drop of blood was produced (about the size of the period at the end of this sentence). This may be enough for a fingerstick blood glucose, but was not sufficient for an INR, which requires a pea-sized drop of blood. I tried again, this time after warming my hand under warm water for a minute in order to increase the blood flow to my fingers. This time, I used a level of 5.5. I was able to get a pea sized drop of blood which was adequate for INR testing. There was essentially no pain with use of the Accu-Chek Fast Click device.",5,0.2591150403022766,0.5556627511978149,0.18522226810455322

RCQYJRWG8FE7Q,B002VWK10E,Overwhelming RUBBER stench,"The footstool is well made (from China)with solid welding of the legs and LOWER handlebar. Assembly (few seconds) involves merely sliding the UPPER handlebar down into the lower one (secured by spring operated metal buttons). The assembled handlebar is very slightly wobbly at the joint, but definitely secure and SAFE. Its purchase was to accommodate our much higher mattress/foundation. Upon arrival and after removing the plastic wrap around the footstool, the rubber stench was very pungent, and relativley overwhelming. I have washed the rubber surface (separately) with lemon scented Mr. Clean detergent (undiluted), white vinegar/water (1:1) soaking for 1/2 hour, baking soda paste (left on over one hour), sprayed on hospital deodorizer (which conceals vomit, fecal, etc odors)and left to bake in direct sunlight for eight hours. The rubber stench is much improved but persists (ie, noticeable as soon as you walk into the room). Googling the remedy for the above, the ONLY likely effective solution is TIME (ie, leave the item in the sun until the odor is tolerable). I got this item ($17.50 more including shipping) instead of the cheaper one (also made in China) because of the latters more involved assembly (poor instructions, suboptimal fasteners, etc), and notable rubber stench. Although not mentioned in the five reviews for THIS footstool, the sample I received definitely has the same problem. That said, the above maneuvers have resulted in an improvement, and I believe with more TIME baking in the sun, I'll be happy with the purchase. However, had I read a review similar to this, I likely would have looked elsewhere (ie, too labor intensive).  UPDATE (7/7/2012): After FOUR weeks of pouring/spreading undiluted white vinegar over the rubber surface, and allowing it to bake in the sun for at least EIGHT hours a day, the rubber stench is essentially GONE (ie, you could BARELY detect a rubber odor with your nostril next to the surface). I've seen similar footstools (but ONE piece handle, rubber STRIPS on surface, and probably not made in China) in catalogs for $100 more. IF you have a keen sense of smell, this footstool is still a cost effective viable option with a bit of work:)",3,0.08581633120775223,0.4347352683544159,0.47944843769073486
R1K2QO4L8FM4SD,B002VWK10E,The stench is unbearable,"As far as the function, this stool is great. We purchased it for my smaller-than-average 3 year old to be able to access the potty and become potty independent. For that, it definitely works. It has a wide enough base to keep her stable through the up and down of the bottoms, the handle is fantastic for giving her a sense of security, and the grippy rubber material adds to the stability under her feet. With smaller plastic and wooden stools she was always afraid she would fall. This stool addresses our problem well. It's not very attractive, for living inside a bathroom that guests see, but it's functional. I'd give it 5 stars but the off-gassing of this product is the worst of any product I have *ever* had.  It came in a box inside another box. As soon as we opened the outer shipping box, the smell took over the room. Once I sliced through the tape on the inner box I had to bolt outside with it because it was so horrible. I left it outside for 24 hours and it's still completely unbearable. I brought it in for 20 minutes to let the kid go potty, and had a massive headache within minutes. I don't know how long this thing will take to de-stench but until it does, it's living outside. I might try spray painting it to see if I can seal in the smell, and to make it more attractive. If I do, I'll update this review, but until then, I'll be Googling ways to make this thing stop stinking up the entire room.  UPDATE: After one month I was able to bring the stool indoors and I don't smell it unless I get close. It sat outside in July/August in the NC heat so I think it got baked off. :)",3,0.36567482352256775,0.37422075867652893,0.2601044178009033
R2CQQPMML2AK2K,B002VWK10E,The step arrived and was easily assembled without tools,"The step arrived and was easily assembled without tools. Also, it works very well to assist my wife with stepping up into our pickup truck. However, the rubber mat appears to have been manufactured hastily because the rubber mat had some large air bubbles in the middle and the mat also was not centered very well in to position on the step. I was able to peel the rubber matting back enough to get the air bubbles out and rearrange its positioning. However, then I had to re-glue the entire rubber mat with a sealant caulking to keep it from separating from the metal step. Hence, the 3-Star rating instead of 5. After I fixed all of that, this step works very well for my wife who is recovering from a partial hip replacement surgery. She couldn't lift her leg high enough to step in to our truck and now she can using this step and with the handle can pull it into the truck once she is seated all by herself. Overall, this step is well made, very sturdy, and should last a lifetime. We will probably bring it into the house after her recovery for her to use reaching for the high shelves in the cupboards.",3,0.021056601777672768,0.2114710956811905,0.7674722671508789

R3RBEBBPUYLY3E,B000VPPUEA,This will not fix your stretch marks!!,"After doing a ton of research when this product did NOTHING, there are only 2 chemicals that will actually do anything to remove newer stretch marks or minimize the appearance of current ones: hyaluronic acid and tretinoin. This is based on actual clinical studies. This product has neither of these chemicals. If your stretch marks fade when using this product, it is because that is naturally what happens over time, not because of this product. Unfortunately amazon does not carry any products that have these chemicals. You have to go to another website, specifically a website that sells RX products to get these chemicals. And it will be more pricey. But the sooner you use these chemicals on stretchmarks, the more effective so do not waste your time with this product. I will not list websites as this review is meant to educate and not to advertise another product.  The vitamins that are in this product are probably great for your skin, but theres a reason the product says “improve stretchmarks” and not words such as prevent or diminish or fade. “Improve” can mean anything and is up to interpretation which is misleading. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FOR STRETCH MARKS.

R3ANUMI5CNF40M,B01IAI4NJ2,Not as Great as Advertised,"I had seen Geritol advertised aggressively on a LOT of network television programs throughout the 1950's and 1960's. I became curious about this miracle elixir so I ordered a bottle.  The liquid is dark brown and syrupy in consistency. The taste is pungent with a prune-like redolence, kind of like sour prune juice. The label says it contains 12% alcohol.  I have never been diagnosed with iron-deficiency anemia. Geritol's slogan for years was ""feel stronger fast"". In early TV ads it promised to make the user feel stronger within 7 days. I took Geritol faithfully for 7 days and I can't honestly say I notice much of a difference in the way I feel. Neither have I developed an abnormal craving for Lawrence Welk music (Geritol used to sponsor Welk's TV show).  I've got to think there are B-vitamin and iron supplements available more economically and in less pungent tablet form than Geritol liquid. Apparently only the liquid contains iron — Geritol tablets do not appear to contain iron.  Now that my curiosity about this widely-heralded tonic has been satiated, I don't think I will spend money for a another bottle of Geritol.",2,0.3986434042453766,0.4464914798736572,0.15486513078212738

R19DXZM50DMQR6,B000CSG5TU,"Good absorption of leakage. Comfortable under clothing. Fairly noisy, crinkly when moving, walking.","I have had steady urinary and occasional bowel incontinence for over 20 years as a result of nerve damage from a motorcycle accident and over these decades I have worn too many brands and styles to recall. I have worn Tranquility brand plastic-backed diapers, including their Slimline diapers and their All-Through-The-Night (ATN) diapers. Comparing these two styles to each other, the Slimlines are thinner, with less absorbent core filler material than the ATN's. I have used the Slimlines while out and about, but I needed booster pads inside to better prevent embarrassing leakage. To not use boosters was always a recipe for disaster, unless I was making a short trip to the grocery store or to pickup a food order because they would inevitably leak. For clarification, my bladder leaks urine pretty constantly in small dribbles, nonstop, without my knowledge whatsoever throughout day or night. I just don't feel anything happening down there and don't realize when my diaper is needing to be changed until there is leakage or the diaper swells enough to be noticeable when I walk or visible under my clothing. A Slimline just doesn't last me for more than two or three hours, especially when I have had a lot of water or some other drinks, or when I have experienced bowel incontinence. In comparison, the ATN diapers get me through twice as many hours and very often can allow me to survive most of my workday without a diaper change until the last hour or so of my workday, except when I have a bowel movement which requires an immediate trip to the restroom, of course. Overnight, the ATN's work pretty well, but I have noticed some leakage from the top-backside of the diaper, which may have more to do with there being no elastic in the tops of the diapers and the fact that I change positions in bed from lying on my back to lying on my side, back and forth. Both the Slimlines and the ATN's are discreet and not thick, which some wearers appreciate. As for me, I have worn slimmer diapers, as well as thicker and bulkier diapers, and I really don't care which style of diaper I wear so long as it does its job to keep me and my clothing dry. I have tried the cloth-like diapers and, in my experience, they tend to leak both urine and odor, which is why I have long preferred plastic-backed diapers. Yes, plastic-backed diapers can be somewhat noisy, making a ""crinkling"" sound when I walk, sit/stand or move, but either nobody else hears it because my clothing muffles those sounds or other people respect my privacy and say nothing (or don't realize the sounds are coming from my diaper). Either way, the crinkling is not a problem for me. I much prefer the noises (loud or soft) to leakage from my diaper. The Slimlines and ATN's are both plastic-backed styles. These both have elastic inner leg gathers, too, which greatly helps to contain and channel voids (urine and feces), which is a feature that some cheaper diapers do not incorporate into their designs in order to reduce manufacturing costs, in my opinion. Even the ATN's with its increased absorption capacity and fast wicking due to its unique peach-colored core down the inside middle of the diapers does not compare with the high-end designer diapers such as those targeted to the ABDL (Adult Baby and/or Diaper Lover) markets, but the cost of the Tranquility ATN's, even with the addition of Tranquility's diaper boosters/inserts to increase void capacity, is significantly more affordable, especially when purchased in bulk (Tranquility's Slimline and ATN medium diapers come in case sizes of 96) and on a recurring autoship monthly basis, which offers a further discount, as well as relieving my worries about running out before remembering to order more diapers and needing to rush ship an order. I normally go through about three, sometimes fpur, diapers per day (morning, evening and overnight), but I can burn through diapers during the Summer when I drink more fluid due to the heat. I also change more frequently when I sweat more, which a plastic-backed diaper can cause you to do, or when I can smell my diaper's contents when I sit or walk, which makes me self-conscious that others, too, can ""smell me""...or when I just feel ""icky"" or notice my diaper bulging through my clothing, or my diaper causing me to walk differently, or when I can hear squishy noises or feel clumping in my diaper (neither, of which, is usually an issue with the ATN diapers, but is often a problem with those cheap diapers that my insurance and the hospital provides for me). So, yeah, I would recommend the Tranquility ATN's for most folks who need them, like myself. They are not fancy with designs all over them, or made to last all day long, but for those qualities I would recommend diapers made for ABDL customers.",5,0.21160666644573212,0.755587637424469,0.032805658876895905
R3TJR1YF1ARSR8,B000CSG5TU,Tranquility All-thru-the-Night (ATN) Diapers are the best diapers for the price,"Hi, For those that never tried this product, this is the Tranquility All-thru-the-night (ATN) Briefs/Diapers. They have the tabs on the side and you have to pull it around to tape the diaper close. They’re also plastic backed diapers not cloth backed. Think of it as a larger version of a traditional disposable baby diaper. If you’re looking for the ones that are like pull ups, Tranquility does offer one called the Tranquility Premium Overnight Pull-On Briefs/Diapers and those are put on like regular underwear. With that said, here is what I think of this product. For the price, I think this is the best disposable diaper out there. I’ve been using this product for about four years now. I tried many different brands but I think overall this is still the best I’ve tried. One reason is that they hold a lot of liquid. What make these diapers stand out is one: they don’t feel wet after I wet them and two: they hold a lot of liquid under pressure. Even after a wetting while sitting, the diaper doesn’t leak. They hold about 34 oz. of liquid (about three to four voids) and while I never went further than two wettings, I think they can still hold up past that. They have what’s called the Peach Mat construction which helps in absorbency as well. They also very durable, lasting over 8 hours. The diaper itself are about mid-pack in terms of thickness. They’re thicker than a Depends Maximum protection, First Quality, Presto, and Assurance brands I’ve tested. The Abena Abri-Forms are thicker as well as the Attends (just somewhat). The Northshore and Confidry brands offer thicker diapers as well. As for fecal containment, this diaper does a good job of containing it. It’s also I think the best at concealing the odor too. I wear the extra-large (fitting 56 – 64 in. waist) and I have plenty of room in them. I can also fit in the size large diapers (fitting 45 – 58 in. waist) too with some room to spare. They’re fairly large so they can fit most. Because they’re not overly thick, they’re fairly easy to conceal under clothing. As long as you don’t wear something too tight, no one should notice these under your clothing. They have a few drawbacks though. One, the tapes to keep the diaper in place are very sticky and once fastened, they’re very difficult to move without tearing the diaper. If you mess up on fastening your diaper close, it’s pretty much stuck and good luck opening it without tearing it. I had this issue a few times but for the most part I can usually avoid this. For those that just ordered or is considering ordering this product just be aware of this when fastening it close. The second drawback is that they crinkle a lot. These are some of the loudest diapers that I ever worn. If noise is an issue for you, then you should consider this before buying. If it isn’t, then I think you should give it a try. For me, this is still the best diaper for me. I still want to try some other brands out there but right now I haven’t found a product that surpasses this one. You usually can find a bag of Tranquility for around $15 bucks, which isn’t too steep. They’re durable, hold a lot of liquid, hold a lot of liquid under pressure, not too thick, fairly easy to conceal, and fit comfortably. Of course, their tapes can be an issue at times and they do crinkle a lot. More so than any brand I’ve tried thus far. In the end, if you’re still interested I think you should really consider trying Tranquility All-thru-the-Night (ATN) Briefs/Diapers. You will be getting a truly exceptional product.  Tranquility ATN (All-through-the-Night) Fitted Briefs Size Extra-Large (XL) Pk/12",5,0.40276286005973816,0.5448257923126221,0.052411362528800964
R336RBQVF42NWH,B000CSG5TU,Diapers for the people!,"These are great! in my experience, they are about the same thickness as the old Depends brand maximum protection diapers, but are by far more reliable, In the past I mainly used the Depends brand, but switched to these last year when the old plastic style Depend started becoming hard to find. I'd estimate these reliably hold about 3 times more than those did anyway. It's difficult to make these leak. Even on the second round I can totally flood it and assuming I don't immediately smash my bottom into a hard surface, it holds very well. Depend told me they are re-engineering their product, but it won't be plastic anymore, so I likely won't buy it again.  ATNs can also be compared to the Tena Slip Maxi (which sadly, has also become very hard to find) I think the Tenas had a sexier look, though the tapes on these ATNs work much better.  I also use the purple Molicare diapers and Abena M4s. Those have higher capacity and they are useful for occasions when I know I won't be able to change for many hours, but I find these ATNs to be much more comfortable (especially at night) and easier to wear in every day life. I can wear a wet ATN under a tight pair of jeans in almost any environment and nobody can tell. Not even my boyfriend who was playing with my butt realized I was wearing it.  My only complaint with these is the excess material in the top. That material probably has some usefulness at night laying down, but in the day time I tuck it way so the diaper does not stick out the top of my pants and become obvious to others around me, but it's a little less comfortable that way (that is one area I feel the Depends and Tena Maxis have the advantage).  Like all the diapers I mentioned, these are also plastic backed. I think plastic diapers are awesome and sad that they are getting so difficult to find anymore. Understandably both plastic and cloth diapers have their advantages. As a caretaker I appreciate ease of the Velcro tapes with the paper diapers for someone laying in bed. But for myself being active, I much prefer platic backed diapers, and on these ATNs, the tapes actually work pretty well.  Plastic diapers have a certain look and feel that makes me proud to wear them, where the paper cloth designs are just depressing. If they ever completely disappear, I'll probably find a way to make my own.  But for now, no need to make my own. As long as these stay in production. I will keep buying them.  About the photos;  The first three pictures compare the Tranquility ATNs with other plastic backed diapers; Depends Maximum Protection (old style), Tena Slip Maxi (difficult to find/ expensive in US), Molicare Super Plus (purple diaper), Abena Abri Form M4 (thick with blue pattern) and North Shore Supreme Briefs (very thick, plain white). All the diapers are plastic backed size medium. With the exception of the Depend, all perform very well. Depend however is probably the most comfortable. Best looking (in my opinion) is the Tena Maxi. M4s and North Shore are the most absorbent, if you don't mind having diaper butt.  The second set set is me (size 32) in the medium ATN. Starting out, its not a very sexy diaper. But with some practice the Excess material can be tucked away (in expense of some comfort) for a better look. Who says diapers can't be fun?",5,0.002246917923912406,0.015634872019290924,0.9821181297302246

R4WZUO69FGW6F,B000CSG5TU,Wish I could give 4..8 stars,"They hold as much liquid as advertised. I’ve used these for several months. They leaked once because they simply overflowed. The diapers were completely full and changed for over ten hours. My only quibble is with the fasteners. I never reattach the fasteners, which is an advertised feature. When using the toilet and they are not wet, I simply pull them down and then back up like regular panties. Once or twice per package of 12, the fasteners would not be capable of being reattached. There are a couple of reasons. That failure is irrelevant to me because of the way I use them. Another fact to keep in mind is that they often need to be changed even when only slightly damp, for reasons of comfort, and a diaper costing a third as much would have sufficed. Your situation might allow you to use a different diaper when you can foresee that huge capacity will not be required. For instance, some might be able to use these high capacity diapers only at night",5,0.5260289311408997,0.39761027693748474,0.0763607993721962

Good thing I’m an Asian mama who’s good at origami! 😂 I kid on that part. But it is harder for my husband to put it together. There’s extra loose, flappy plastic on the front of the diaper that doesn’t have absorption that I just fold down so it’s not uncomfortable on my son/ bother his belly skin.

R1PGWVRBT8D1H0,B000CSG5TU,High capacity even keeps g-tube fed kids dry overnight,"My daughter is neurotypical but has EGID and is completely g-tube feed a medical formula. Including her extra prescribed water, she takes in 2200+ mL of liquid daily, so night accidents are a given. We have used ATN pull-on briefs in the past and were happy with them. A few minor leaks, but probably due to shifting while she slept. Unfortunately, my daughter wouldn't tell us when she was nearly out, only when she was totally out. Not helpful when even Amazon prime needs until tomorrow to get them to us. We switched to ""regular"" Depends/generic type products since we could get them anywhere at the last minute. We had LOTS of leaks - some nights I wondered if she even had put one on (she had -- it just was flooded too). Talking to other tubey moms, I found out about the ""tabbed"" product. Several of them recommended it. Tired of all the leaking and wet beds, I decided we would give them a try.  These are fantastic. Even better than the pull-on style. The adjustable sides make them fit far better - so they don't shift at all. They stay snug against her legs/hips. It's been a week since we started using them and the bed has been dry EVERY night. (Super appreciated at the moment since our washer is awaiting the repairman and the parts he ordered.)  DD is 8YO, and about 55 lbs, and they fit her very well. My 2YO DS (about 25 lbs) also has a G-tube. We've tried overnight diaper and pull-ups, in multiple sizes, and they aren't cutting it. Even changing him before I go to bed, he is drenched when the wakes up. (He gets 500-600 mL in night feeds.) The other night, I went to change him before I went to bed and found we were out of pull-ups in his room. I didn't feel like going back downstairs, so I grabbed one of these from her closet. Yes, it was a little big (the tapes crossed over each other in the front vs. over the hips when I secured it), but it WORKED. No wet clothes, no wet bed! I will look into the XS ones for him, but if they are hard to find, I'll just stick with these. The extra time it takes to tuck the sides around is worth it if he stays dry! (It also may help me keep a closer eye on our supply so we don't run short.)",5,0.21782039105892181,0.7365003228187561,0.04567926377058029

The taste resembles grapes, but the texture is quite chalky. I don't mind, because the tablets are very small and dissolve quickly. I find these better than conventional OTC cold and flu medications, which only work to relieve symptoms, but don't actually do anything to help you get over the sickness faster. Elderberry is different because it boosts your immune system so that it can fight off illnesses quickly. It is a very good natural method of alternative medicine. I have never had cold or flu symptoms last more than 1-2 days ever since I started taking elderberry and vitamin C as soon as I get sick. Not a supplement, so do not take these every day. Works best if you take them at first sign of a runny nose or sore throat. (Doesn't work for coughs though.)

R2WO7PVP5K5MRN,B001ES8GGC,A must-have staple for every medicine cabinet,"This is my absolute go to product when I feel a cold or illness coming on. My kids love the taste - it's kind of a grape sweet tart taste almost, not medicinal so they actually enjoy taking it if they're sick and it dissolves fast. I've tried other products from this same company and I much prefer the quick dissolve tablets than the other versions like liquid or the hard lozenge. It tastes better, and honestly works a ton better I've found than the other presentations of Sambucol. I think it's got some additional ingredients so that may be why. I use this about 3-4 times a day as soon as I'm feeling something coming on or my kids were getting sick, and it's really lessened the amount of colds in our house, and duration if someone does get a cold. My health hasn't been great the past few months and my kids actually got a few colds that I was just sure I'd get, but I took this religiously and escaped 3 colds in our house and my kids got over theirs quicker too. I recently had to give up ibuprofen and tylenol due to stomach issues, and I actually use this now when I get a headache since I can't take pain relievers. It works well for me in that respect too so this is kind of my all-around go to line of defense wonder supplement.",5,0.019124532118439674,0.11933860182762146,0.8615368604660034

After that I asked her where the Airborne was because I was getting a cold.

RJSFFM72V9KXR,B001ES8GGC,I think this stuff could cure the plague!,"I had some in my medicine cabinet that I had purchased in the fall in anticipation of flu season, and I had heard friends recommending it on Facebook. Fast forward to about 6 weeks ago, I start getting super sick. Like “make sure your affairs are in order” and “Jesus is coming” sick. When I began to spike a fever, I knew death was imminent. As I’m rifling through various cold medicines, I see the Sambucol I had providentially purchased months ago. The box says for cold and flu, and seeing as how everything else I had tried did nothing, I figured one more thing couldn’t hurt. After the 3rd dose, my fever (which had gotten to 103.7) began to abate. My body still felt like I had been mistaken for a crash test dummy, but I began to feel like I may not need a priest just yet... after 24 hours of taking every 3 hours, my fever went down. At this point, my family (hubby and 4 kids at home) began dropping like flies... turns out all but 2 of us had the flu (in spite of the flu shot, which I know is something of a crap shoot anyway). Recovery from the flu, based on the few times I’ve had it, is long and arduous. I only missed 3 days of work (I began to get sick late in the week before my symptoms escalated over the weekend), and I firmly believe it was because of the Sambucol. Everyone in the family who got sick recovered faster. Incidentally, I got the gummies and made everyone take them as preventative, and 2 kids didn’t even get sick, so there’s that. Anyway, I highly recommend this product.",5,0.3882169723510742,0.4243937134742737,0.18738926947116852

R2TUZXKXK5KFYV,B00DUGURH2,Works amazingly well,I was quite skeptical that this would actually work well to eliminate the ostomy pouch odor  Not any more..this is shockingly an amazing product.

It's inexpensive enough to last a long time....no more embarrassing outgas problems any more.  You can't go wrong with this product,5,0.03807620704174042,0.09787645936012268,0.8640473484992981

It is very stable so it almost never tips even though they move and wiggle all over while they stand on it. (Has tipped maybe 1 or 2 times with constant use for a month plus.)

R1ZC4ATAOYC626,B005ALUJBY,Excellent for.extreme allergies,"These are fabulous for endless allergies. I have become immune to the effects of almost every allergy medicine over the years, after 6 months to 2 years, each kind becomes ineffective until now. I hope I do not jinx myself but it's been about 4 years, probably more. Oddly, the benadryl pink ""tabs"" I think they are weaker or a different formula because they do not work like the ""dye free gel caps"". These act quickly and work very well on food allergies, tree and pollen allergies, and even exposure type allergies from being in public places with strong scents or airborne unknowns that make the sinuses and body go haywire. This works the fastest and longest of any I have tried including all prescription allergy meds. Perhaps I am allergic to the ""dye"" in others and so it defeats the purpose. The only thing it doesn't always help is extreme stuffiness. It stops everything else but often I eventually need a decongestant if I do not take a benadryl quickly enough.  I am so very thankful for this particular allergy medicine because it is so miserable to be so sick from allergic reactions,you can only prevent so many and can only avoid so many things and have any kind of life especially when your body just decides that everything is an allergen.  If you are at a loss and have tried other benadryl types, give the dye free a try, perhaps you will get lucky. I just pray some idiot doesn't find a way to use it for nefarious purposes resulting in my not being able to get it online anymore since I avoid unnecessary exposures to allergens, like drugstores.etc. I also pray the fda doesn't find out it works, as it seems medicine that works is often taken off the market after 10 years of helping people (sarcastic exaggeration) for being..gasp! EFFECTIVE!  If you get severe allergies,system ones that are horrendous but do not require an epi pen, cold sweats,chills,sinus symptoms, flu like symptoms, rashes,.etc, this has been helpful for me with really bad.systemic allergic reactions.",5,0.3855598270893097,0.38193801045417786,0.23250222206115723

My face had swollen to thrice its size, my eyes had sunk in completely and my neck had turned red with red circles around it. I could not breathe very well and thought I needed to go to the ER. Took two Benadryl at night, immersed my entire body in sandalwood talcum powder which is soothing and cooling, prayed and went to bed. Fell asleep shortly and woke up in the morning. Looked in the mirror and my allergies had gone from life threatening to a few rashes on my neck, chest and back. Swelling had completely subsided and I could see myself in the mirror again.

I have small children and am able to wake up quickly in the night if they need me - I'm able to function well, don't feel drowsy - but when I get back into my bed I fall right back to sleep. For me Benadryl helps stop me from thinking of the endless things I need to do - if you have ever been trying to fall asleep at night and have lists running through your mind of things you forgot to do, or things you need to do tomorrow, Benadryl just helps to 'quiet' your mind so you can get the sleep your body needs.

When these are put on properly and the fit is correct to your body they work quite well. They can also be readjusted through the day with the second chance tape to make them tighter. I usually take the little extra time and make sure the leak guard is properly pulled up around your body parts and the leg gathers are tight around the leg. These will hold a large amount of wettings if you want to use the tranquility top liner super booster pad with the diaper as well. I can go all day in one diaper without a change and stay dry with the booster pad. The booster adds that extra bit of protection and slowly releases into the diaper as to not flood it.

R3Q1Y3DRASBKWC,B000CSG5TU,Good diaper for daytime use,"We have used Tranquility ATN fitted briefs ever since my son outgrew the largest size of Pampers. He is now 12 and 70 pounds. He is severely disabled, g-tube fed, and gets a lot of water to help him with his bowels. We change his diaper very frequently, so we do go through a lot of these. They do sometimes leak, but I think that is just how it goes. (No pun intended.:)) We don't use them for overnight, though. We lay my son on his side while he sleeps (he can't move voluntarily), to help him with his breathing, so he would always leak out when using these at night. We now use Molicare Super Plus at night and have few accidents. (We currently are buying them from Overstock.com - it is the cheapest place for his size.) However, we like the ATN's for every day. They are much better than all the others we have tried. If you wonder why we don't use the Molicare for daytime if they are so much better, it is because I find it difficult to tell when they are wet. I think they are supposed to be 8 hour diapers, but we change my son frequently during the day, and with the ATN's you can tell at a glance if they are wet or not. Plus, they are not too bulky.

R26HOPTDERP358,B000VPPUEA,Smells and feels great!,"I was so close to giving this a 5 Star and perhaps in the future I'll be able to up it. Product: The oil is sooo silky smooth, it feels great to rub on and it has a pleasant scent. It does leave a little bit of residue on your hands but that's to be expected, I usually just do a small rub on a different part of my body that I was not initially oiling and if that doesn't rid it, it fades in a few quick moments so it is of no real bother. Purpose: I purchased Bio-Oil after hearing friends recommend it for years for scars, and a few for stretch marks and I have been using it largely on my stomach for both. I've had stretch marks for years - definitely bits and pieces of weight gain and loss - but these bad boys are a little dramatic for the changes I've had. This August (2023) I had gallbladder removal through laparoscopy so I have 4 little cuts/scars with 3 more noticeable. I've had it for a little over 2 months now, trying my ADHD damnedest to follow instructions and do it regularly, but I definitely miss a day here and there or only get it applied once during some days as well. Given the time frame and my accidental misuse, I don't have a TON to report as of yet. My skin does feel super soft and moisturized. I ~THINK~ I notice some mild improvement on appearance of the stretch marks, but unfortunately as of now I notice no difference at all with the scarring. I will likely try to take an 'unofficial' before pic or two soon, and then continue to try to do better at full instructions and report back. Note: I have just under half of the bottle left, so I think if I'd followed it a bit better I'd only just now be coming up to the end of the bottle (again this is covering basically my whole stomach and the round part of each hip so I'm doing quite a bit with it).

R2J2R5BZAL3U8O,B01IAI4NJ2,Tastes like sucking on a metal coat hanger,Ordered the twin pack but only got one. Amazon credited me for the missing one. Glad I only got one. Started taking these by recommendation from a couple of co workers. They believe the benefits of it overcomes the awful taste. I can’t say I agree with them. I’m going to try to finish off the bottle and I think I’ll look for other better tasting ways to get my iron and maybe take a different supplement so it doesn’t stop me up. The taste is just gross. Like sucking on a store’s metal coat hanger. I hold my breath and take it like a shot quickly and then drown it out with something strong like orange juice. The problem I’m finding with it is no matter whether I eat before I take it or not it makes me burp it up for hours after taking it and the smell is gross and the aftertaste. But it doesn’t stop you up like other iron supplements. That’s one positive I can say about it. I think it’s great if you can handle it but I just don’t think I can. I refrigerate it to try to help it some. I don’t think it makes any difference. I read the reviews first about the taste. Some people like it and others can tolerate it. I’m still deciding if I can stand to take the whole bottle or not. If it didn’t make me burp I think I could handle it better.,3,0.5113860368728638,0.3672843277454376,0.12132960557937622
